This is a simple stepper motor controlver over RS232/USB/... for 
the arduino platform based on the AccelStepper library.

(C) Jörg-Karl Bösner 2015

The protocoll is as following:

D:M:C:P

D = Device Number, 0 = all devices
M = Motor Number, 0 = all motors, ignored if not used, but must be present
C = Command out of the following table
P = A parameter if used, can be integer / float in international notation


The motor pins and driver are hardcoded atm. So please adjust the source!


Commands:

A - Set device address to all connected devices (dafault 0)
    0:0:A:newAddress

B - Set baudrate
    X:0:B:baudrate

S - Set Speed (default 0)
    X:N:S:FLOAT

X - Set Acceleration (default 1)
    X:N:X:FLOAT

R - runs the Motor at constant speed
    X:N:R

H - Halts the motor
    X:N:H

P - Sets the actual position
    X:N:P:FLOAT

M - Moves the Motor to this position at once and stops after that. Uses acceleration. Starts immidiatly.
    X:N:M:FLOAT

G - Moves the Motor this amount of steps and stops after that. Uses acceleration. Starts immidiatly.
    X:N:G:FLOAT

    
=== Depends on the implementation in AccelStepper library ===
The prototypes are there, but since the lib does not support
reading back the values set, it is not quite usefull atm.
    
N - saves motor setting to non volatile Memory (only speed supported atm)
    X:0:N
    
L - loads motor setting from non volatile Memory (only speed supported atm)
    X:0:L
